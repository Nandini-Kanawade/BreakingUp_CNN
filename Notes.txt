All descending order.
U = normalized eigen vectors of S Left (AAt)
Sigma= Diagonal matrix of Singular Values of A (root(lamba)) 
Vt = transpose of normalised eigen vectors of S Right (AtA)

the right-the blue matrix or v transpose is an orthogonal matrix which 
applies a rotation such that the right singular vectors return to the 
standard basis so more precisely the singular vector with the 
biggest singular value lands on x-axis the singular vector with the 
second biggest singular value goes on the y-axis and so forth.

the matrix sigma is rectangularly diagonal and it's essentially 
a square diagonal matrix composed with a dimension eraser is. 
It removes third dimension and so the diagonal matrix stretches 
x and the y axis based on the

singular value and the final step the matrix u rotates the 
standard basis to align with the left singular vectors
